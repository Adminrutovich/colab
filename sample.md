There was a Fir-Tree born in woods,
And there she was grown,
In winter and in summer both
The grace and green she was

The Snowstorm sang a song for her:
«Sleep, Firry, sleep tight-tight»
The Frost was covering with snow:
“Don't freeze in such cold night”

A yellow-bellied Bunny there
Was leaping under fir
From time to time an angry Wolf
Was running over near

The snow around the thicky woods
Is creaking under skid
A shaggy Gee-Gee frisks ahead
In greatest rush indeed

The Gee-Gee's carrying firewoods
On them there is a Man
He chopped down our little Fir
At the very rootlet

And now in gallant here she is
On feast to us she came
And many many joyances
All little kids she gave
